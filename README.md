#Text Formatter Sample

##Introduction
This application is a tech demo that shows how to format text in an EditText field. You can bold or italicize some or all of the text, as well as add paragraph indents. It also shows a NavigationDrawer (although the drawer doesn't contain anything yet).

###To Do
- Get sections to show up in drawer
- Implement underlining

##Walkthrough
1. Open the project in your Android development IDE of choice.
2. Run the app. (It was tested on a Nexus 5 API 21 emulator during development.)
3. Click on the menu icon in the upper left to open and close the NaviagtionDrawer.
4. Highlight some text and click the Italic or Bold button to italicize or bold the selected text.
5. Click on the upper right menu button to bring up a list of other actions. Click Paragraph to indent all of the paragraphs.
